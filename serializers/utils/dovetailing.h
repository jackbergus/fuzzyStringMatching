/*
 * It can be showed that, in order to represent in secondary memory matrices with truncated files
 * having 10^9 vertices, and if we want to use dovetailing for defining new indices, then we have to
 * check which is the most large representation allowing to represent 10^9 vertices with dovetailing
 *
 * Moreover, the problem with dovetailing is that it can index all the possible integers, and hence the
 * actual representation can explode immediately. We want to define a dovetailing function which is limited
 * by a given value.
 *
 * The way a matrix is indexed provides a great approximation of this:
 *
 * sequential_index(i,j) = i*m + j
 *
 * where, in particular m is the maximum j representable. Hereby, we want that the maximum dovetailing
 * fits into a machine representation which is M = 2^n bits wide, and that i, j fit in this representation
 * too. Hereby, given a the maximum value for both i, j (and consequently, m), we have that
 *
 * i * m + j <= M
 * a(a+1) + a <= M
 *
 * this means that the maximum value is solved by
 *
 * a (a+1) + a = M
 *
 * the non negative solution is then
 *
 * a = sqrt(M + 1) - 1
 *
 * We can observe that the M that allows to represent  a = 10^9 is 2^4, and hence the matrix shall be
 * indexed by only using uint64_t integers. Since the result is 4, this means that the maximum nesting
 * levels for the whole representation is 4
