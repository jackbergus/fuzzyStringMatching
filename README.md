# fuzzyStringMatching

This library provides a support for performing fuzzy string matching in secondary memory. If the data to be indexed increases the primary memory size, the current code provides some classes performing external merge sorts over variadic data via [varsorter](https://github.com/jackbergus/varsorter).
